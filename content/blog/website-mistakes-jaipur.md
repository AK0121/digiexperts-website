### 1. Slow Loading Websites  
Speed matters. In India, mobile users bounce if your site takes >3 seconds.  
**Fix**: Compress images, use better hosting, optimize code.

### 2. No Clear Call to Action  
Visitors get confused — no “Call Us,” “Book Now,” or “Get a Quote” visible.  
**Fix**: Use bold buttons, sticky CTA bars.

### 3. Looks Bad on Mobile  
50%+ of traffic in Jaipur is from smartphones.  
**Fix**: Use responsive design and test on real devices.

### 4. Outdated Design = Less Trust  
Old-school fonts, cluttered layouts = low trust.  
**Fix**: Modern UI, clean spacing, minimalism = professionalism.

### 5. No SEO or Google Presence  
If your site can’t be found on Google, it doesn’t exist.  
**Fix**: Add meta tags, optimize page titles, create a Google Business Profile.
